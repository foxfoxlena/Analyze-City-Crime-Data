# City crime data analysis and modeling
This ipython notebook creates a template for city crime data analysis using Spark SQL. 

## Dataset
I used SF crime data as an example, which can be downloaded at https://data.sfgov.org/Public-Safety/Police-Department-Incident-Reports-Historical-2003/tmnf-yvry.
Note: One can download the small data (one month e.g. 2018-10) for debug, then download the data from 2013 to 2018 for testing and analysising.
For crime data for other cities, one can download on the corresponding gov.org/Public-Safety, and simply follow this notebook template. The data format is almost same.


## Running environment
The running environment is databricks community edition, which is free to use.
